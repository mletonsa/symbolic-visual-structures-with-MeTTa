## Project: Pattern Discovery in Symbolic Visual Structures

This is the first post for a blog documenting the "Pattern Discovery in Symbolic Visual Structures" project funded by SingularityNET Foundation.

I have just added initial instruction for setting up the system. Requirements ARC-AGI dataset and the latest Hyperon Docker image.

I will soon add here some background information for the project as well as research plan.
