# Pattern Discovery in Symbolic Visual Structures

This project explores concept blending as a mechanism for abstract pattern discovery in symbolic visual structures, with a focus on tasks inspired by the ARC-AGI challenge. We implement an information-theoretic concept blending algorithm within the MeTTa language of the Hyperon framework, targeting the induction of reusable abstractions from small, discrete visual examples. Symbolic visual structures—such as shape groupings, spatial relations, and symmetry patterns—are represented as hypergraphs in the Atomspace. Blending operations generate higher-level concepts that generalize across tasks.
